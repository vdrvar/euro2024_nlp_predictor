The England Euro 2024 squad has been finalised, and one question is on the lips of every Three Lions fan and detractor - if not now, when? And If not Gareth, whom? England travel to Germany as joint-favourites (with France) to lift their first major trophy in nearly 60 years, acutely aware that this summer represents a final shot at Euros glory for many of the party. Though Southgate has refused to be drawn on his post-tournament plans, many of the manager's favourites will be 30-plus by kick-off. Jordan Pickford, Harry Kane - naturally one of the favourites for the Golden Boot - Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier and John Stones may feel it's now or never in terms of lifting the Henri Delaunay Trophy. That sextet all started against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup semi-final, all featured against Italy in the Euro 2020 final and, unused substitute Trippier aside, all fell against France in the Qatar quarters. Fourth time lucky?Fortunately, a formidable group of younger talents share their ambition, from the marauding midfield presence of Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden's ethereal genius. Yet the Three Lions' most dazzling gem is 20-year-old world-beater Jude Bellingham, who defied all reasonable expectation in becoming Real Madrid's key player and de facto leader in his maiden season after joining from Borussia Dortmund. That's without even mentioning Trent Alexander-Arnold and Declan Rice, while the in depth in attack is boosted by Cole Palmer, Ollie Watkins, Anthony Gordon and even Jarrod Bowen - all of whom are very capable of stepping in if required.With such talent at his disposal (now including 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo, who excelled on debut and may start), Southgate will inevitably find himself castigated by some fans for refusing to field all of them at once. But the former defender's belief that clean sheets win tournaments has made him England's most successful manager since Sir Alf Ramsey, so defenestrating his tactical blueprint this late is unthinkable.Expect this Three Lions line-up to be stubborn over spectacular, especially in the knockout ties, and flexible enough to switch to a back three against top- class opposition. In talismanic captain Kane, who found his feet quickly at Bayern Munich, England have a focal point who makes the most of meagre opportunities.Should the Three Lions navigate their way to another semi-final again, the fixtures could be pitted against their World Cup 2022 conquerors France, with hosts Germany or Portugal probably waiting for them in the final. First, though, Denmark, Serbia and Slovenia await England in the group stages. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.As with every team at the tournament, FourFourTwo will bring you all the latest on England as we report live from the European Championship, from the stadium at each Three Lions game.

In both of those games, though, he had to forego Jude Bellingham in the attacking midfield spot, instead opting for Cole Palmer and Phil Foden to deputise. The Real Madrid man will inevitably slot straight back in for the the first game, though. Elsewhere, Harry Maguire's absence means that Marc Guehi looks like he'll be the player to get the nod at centre-back, while Luke Shaw will start at left-back if he's fully fit. The Manchester United man is the squad's only recognised left-back, though fitness issues suggests Kieran Trippier could fill in there while he continues to make a full recovery. Following an impressive breakthrough season at Manchester United in which he made his England debut, Kobbie Mainoo could also start in central midfield alongside Declan Rice, while Phil Foden occupies the left-wing slot. Trent Alexander-Arnold could, however, step into central midfield if he continues to impress Southgate in the build-up to the tournament. England Euro 2024 squad numbersSwipe to scroll horizontallyEngland Euro 2024 squad numbersNo.PlayerPos1Jordan PickfordGK2Kyle WalkerDF3Luke ShawDF4Declan RiceMF5John StonesDF6Marc GuéhiDF7Bukayo SakaFW8Trent Alexander-ArnoldMF9Harry Kane (captain)FW10Jude BellinghamMF11Phil FodenFW12Kieran TrippierDF13Aaron RamsdaleGK14Ezri KonsaDF15Lewis DunkDF16Conor GallagherMF17Ivan ToneyFW18Anthony GordonFW19Ollie WatkinsFW20Jarrod BowenFW21Eberechi EzeMF22Joe GomezDF23Dean HendersonGK24Cole PalmerMF25Adam WhartonMF26Kobbie MainooMFThe England squad numbers were released on Saturday 8 June.Maguire's absence sees Marc Guehi step into the No.6, while Saka and Alexander-Arnold take the No.7 and No.8 away from Jack Grealish and Jordan Henderson, respectively, with the latter pair failing to make the final squad. After wearing the No.22 in each of the last two tournaments, Jude Bellingham has been upgraded to the No.10 in place of Raheem Sterling, while Phil Foden moves from No.20 to No.11. There are a number of players who will wear the same number for England as they do for their clubs, with Jordan Pickford, Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Kane the obvious ones. Ivan Toney takes the No.17 – the jersey he dons for Brentford – while Jarrod Bowen wears No.20, just as he does at West Ham United.As with Euro 2020, Southgate has given two of the more inexperienced members of the squad, Adam Wharton and Kobbie Mainoo, the No.25 and No.26 respectively, just as he did with Saka and Bellingham at the last Euros. England fixtures and resultsEngland were beaten by Iceland (Image credit: Getty Images)March 23: England 0-1 Brazil, Wembley Stadium, London, England (Friendly)

Now, he's only second to Alf Ramsey in terms of success in the Three Lions gig.The 53-year-old has a reputation for keeping the handbrake firmly on but his sensible approach has been rewarded with consistent runs deep in tournaments – and as the talent at Southgate's fingertips has developed, so have his beliefs, with England's attacking talents running riot at the World Cup in 2022.England's star playerJude BellinghamBellingham has emerged as the team's key player (Image credit: Getty Images)Jude Bellingham finished his first season as a Real Madrid player by winning the Champions League in his home country against his former club: now, he could cap off the season of his dreams with an international trophy, too.Bellingham is an all-action midfield superstar cut from the same cloth as Steven Gerrard and – dare we say it – Gazza. Top-scoring for Los Blancos this season, with countless stoppage-time goals, the 20-year-old has the clutch gene and will be looking to bring his impeccable timing to the England squad this summer. Lesson from qualifyingGallagher, Kane and Wharton (Image credit: Getty Images)Mainoo's sudden emergence and Trent Alexander-Arnold's man-of-the-match midfield display against Malta have given Southgate a selection headache. Both have the vision and engine to run a game from deep, but is the Jordan Henderson fanboy courageous enough to unleash either? Though only France, Spain and Portugal outscored England in qualifying, the 1-0 friendly defeat to Brazil and draw against Belgium, with Ivan Toney sneaking ahead of Watkins after a decent showing, proved how thankless it is to be Kane's understudy. StrengthsPickford will wear the No.1 in Germany (Image credit: Getty Images)Experience and familiarity. England's goalkeeper and most of the backline have featured at the last trio of major tournaments, and their constellation of midfielders and forwards have played together on countless occasions. The group is supportive, settled and seems to love spending time together, even welcoming up-and-coming new faces - a far cry from previous eras' nods, cliques and sewing circles of mistrust. WeaknessesInjuries could prove an issue (Image credit: Getty Images)Defensive depth. Right-footed Trippier has often had to play at left-back with injuries to Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell, and the unavailability of any of Stones, Rice and, yes, Maguire would be a big blow to Southgate. The gaffer's loyalty to 31-year-old Maguire could prove a problem, too, especially when the Manchester United man won't be a the tournament and the younger, more mobile alternative in Marc Guehi has had limited opportunities thus far. Pickford's mistake against Belgium is also a slight worry. Most likely to...Proclaim continental dominance with Boxpark beer showers and lit rectal flares... after an unconvincing 1-0 win against Serbia in the first group game. Least likely to...Convert from 12 yards. The Three Lions' penalty hoodoo was supposedly put to bed after the 2018 World Cup's victory over Colombia, but further heartbreak against Italy in the Euro 2020 final and Kane's ballooned effort against France two summers ago tell a different story. What they hope will happenA kneeling Southgate, winners' medal dangling over a fitted M&S waistcoat, is knighted on the Buckingham Palace steps by a rosy-cheeked King Charles. New England supremo Pep Guardiola announces his humble ambition to try to build on his predecessor's success.What will happenA spirited semi-final exit, inevitably on penalties. Southgate vows to stay on for one last World Cup, to widespread grumbling from fans claiming England would be European champions if only Grealish had started every single game.KitsHome kitEngland home kit (Image credit: Getty Images)Nike have spoken of 'taking a prismatic approach' to updating the colour scheme of each country's new kit and England are no exception.
