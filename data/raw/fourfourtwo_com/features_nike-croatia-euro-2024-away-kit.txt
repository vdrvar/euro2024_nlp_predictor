The Croatia Euro 2024 away kit is ready for the tournament in Germany this summer, and it's a level above anything Nike have ever managed for the nation before.With every Euro 2024 kit now confirmed, fans will know exactly how each squad will be looking at Euro 2024. Some nations have been handed brilliant designs by their respective manufacturers, while others might have been hoping for something a little better. Some, though, didn't even get a bespoke kit...Fortunately for Croatia, they'll be among countries looking the best at Euro 2024, with their away kit set to do the business.The Croatia Euro 2024 away kit is undoubtedly an upgrade on the previous shirtBUY THE SHIRTSHOP NIKE KITS Buy this shirt from Nike.comIn a shirt that Nike claims pays homage to the World Cup semi-finalists from 1998 - a period in which Lotto manufactured Croatia's kits - there seems to be little resemblance between the suggestion and the reality, apart from the use of blue.What is certain, though, is the latest design looks fantastic. In 2022, the Croatia away kit came in slightly darker blue with streaks of checkerboard on the shoulder. It looked fine, but nothing screamed quality in the same way the two-tone, slanted checkerboard pattern does this time around.Nike Croatia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Getty Images)SEE THE HOME(Image credit: Nike)EURO 2024 KITS Croatia's Euro 2024 home kitWhat truly stands out for FourFourTwo, though, is the streaks of red cutting across some of the squares. While they're used quite sparingly, it helps to add a splash of colour to a refined design, in keeping with the nation's crest and flag.The round-neck collar is also a change from the polo collar used on the home kit, helping create something a bit more bespoke and interesting. Because who likes the colours being changed on the exact same kit between home and away? Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nike Croatia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike/Croatia)While Luka Modric and Co. might not wear the away strip too much in Germany, they're sure to stand out if they ever get the opportunity. Buy the shirtCroatia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike/Croatia)Nike Croatia Euro 2024 away shirt    A clear upgrade on something that was already stunningOur expert review:    SpecificationsColour: yper Royal/Deep Royal Blue/University Red/WhiteSize: XS-XXXLToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonVisit SiteReasons to buy+Slanted checks+Two-tone blue+Red streaks throughout More kit dropsNike have released all of their shirts, after Adidas dropped theirs.Belgium's home kit is a deeper red, with their away kit Tintin-inspired. Germany's home jersey and away jersey have gradient-style patterns, while Italy's home shirt and away shirt and Hungary's home kit and away kit are more subtle. The Spain home shirt and away shirt are both inspired by nature. France's home kit and away kit are brighter than recent moody efforts, as is the Netherlands home kit. The away kit, meanwhile, is more artistic: and Portugal have similar: their last Nike home jersey is a lighter red, with their away kit inspired by art.For Britain, England's home kit and away kit visit different ends of a spectrum. Scotland's home shirt is modern and brash while the away shirt is calmer in tone. Wales are yet to qualify – but their home shirt and away shirt are both safe options.
