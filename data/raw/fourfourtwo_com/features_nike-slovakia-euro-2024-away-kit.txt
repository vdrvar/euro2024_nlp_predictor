Where to buy








The Slovakia Euro 2024 away kit has been released, with Nike playing it extremely safe for this effort.With the majority of Euro 2024 kits now out, excitement is building in each nation ahead of the tournament in Germany. In Slovakia it might be less so, though, with Nike just sticking their away kit on top of a template design. Some may love it, but the majority will undoubtedly be indifferent. It's not offensive or garish, there's just a lack of love shown to the central European nation ahead of Euro 2024. The Slovakia Euro 2024 away kit is bland and boring BUY THE SHIRTSHOP NIKE KITS Buy this shirt from Nike.comLooking more akin to a training top, the Slovakia Euro 2024 away kit is just white with a blue Swoosh and the nation's two crests. That's it.There's no subtle design element that helps it stand out, or an interesting colour added to the top to help it stand out. It's just white, stuck onto a Nike Vapor IV template.Sure, the numbers look quite cool, but other than that there's literally nothing interesting about the new kit. There's some saving grace, though - with Slovakia playing against Belgium, Ukraine and Romania in the group stages, they shouldn't need to play in their change strip.Regardless, this just highlights how lazy the design actually is. It seems like Nike haven't even bothered because the brand believes Slovakia will be unable to progress to the knockouts. It's scandalous, really. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Slovakia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike)SEE THE HOME(Image credit: Nike)EURO 2024 KITS Slovakia's Euro 2024 home kitSlovakia could debut the new away kit against either San Marino or Wales in the pre-tournament friendlies, as they prepare for Euro 2024 in Germany with a less-than inspiring kit. Buy the shirtSlovakia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike)Nike Slovakia Euro 2024 away shirt  Don't expect this to stand out in GermanyOur expert review:  SpecificationsColour: White/blueSize: XS-3XLToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Clean Reasons to avoid-Uninspiring and boring-Just a white kit stuck on More kit dropsAdidas have dropped their Euro 2024 kits. Belgium's home kit is deep red, with a blue away kit on the cards, while Germany's home shirt and away shirt are both gorgeous. The Italy home shirt and away shirt, and Hungary's home shirt and away shirt are all minimal – as is the Spain home shirt, while their away shirt opts for a yellow/blue/red mix. Nike have released their shirts, too. France's home kit is brighter blue, while their away kit is pinstriped. The Netherlands home kit and away kit are both bolder than ever, while Portugal's last Nike home jersey and away kit are both guaranteed hits.Back in Blighty, England's home shirt is 80s-inspired, with the away shirt something brand new. Scotland's home shirt is a modern take on tartan while the away shirt is light blue/green. Wales haven't qualified yet – but have a classic home shirt and bright yellow away shirt.
