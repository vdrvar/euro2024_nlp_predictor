The Slovakia Euro 2024 squad announcement is just around the corner, as the central European country prepare for their second-ever European Championships.While they lost both matches to Portugal in qualifying, reaching Euro 2024 proved relatively straightforward for Slovakia, who finished in second and five points ahead of third-placed Luxembourg.That's hardly surprising when considering some of the quality in the Slovakia Euro 2024 squad, however, with Milan Skriniar a rock at the back, the ever-dependable Ondrej Duda in midfield and, of course, current captain Juraj Kucka. But with Marek Hamsik retired in the summer of 2023, Slovakia have lost their talismanic figure who guided the team through much of the last 15 years.The group stages won't be easy for Slovakia, either, despite their ease with reaching the tournament. Drawn in Group E alongside Belgium, Romania and Ukraine, the Slovakia Euro 2024 squad will need to be on top form if they're to reach the knockout stages. As with every Euro 2024 squad, FourFourTwo will bring you all the latest on Slovakia as we report live from the European Championship, including details on their fixtures and how to watch every game. Slovakia's squadSlovakia Euro 2024 squad: The squad for the March friendlies against Austria and NorwayGK: Martin Dubravka (Newcastle)GK: Henrich Ravas (New England Revolution)GK: Marek Rodak (Fulham)DF: Peter Pekarik (Hertha Berlin)DF: Norbert Gyomber (Salernitana)DF: Milan Skriniar (PSG)DF: Denis Vavro (Copenhagen)DF: Lubomir Satka (Samsunspor)DF: Vernon De Marco (Hatta)DF: David Hancko (Feyenoord)DF: Matus Kmet (Trencin)DF: Michal Tomic (Slavia Prague)MF: Juraj Kucka (Slovan Bratislava)MF: Stanislav Lobotka (Napoli)MF: Ondrej Duda (Verona)MF: Patrik Hrosovsky (Genk)MF: Erik Jirka (Viktoria Plzen)MF: Laszlo Benes (Hamburg)MF: Tomas Suslov (Verona)MF: Dominik Holly (Jablonec)FW: Robert Mak (Sydney FC)FW: Ivan Schranz (Slavia Prague)FW: Lukas Haraslin (Sparta Prague)FW: Robert Polievka (Dukla Banska Bystrica)FW: Lubomir Tupta (Slovan Liberec)FW: Robert Bozenik (Boavista)FW: Jakub Kadak (Luzern)FW: David Strelec (Slovan Bratislava on loan from Spezia)FW: David Duris (Ascoli on loan from MSK Zilina)FW: Leo Sauer (Feyenoord)Slovakia Euro 2024 squad numbersThe Slovakia Euro 2024 squad numbers will be unveiled when the squad is announced. Slovakia manager: Francesco CalzonaFrancesco Calzona, Slovakia manager (Image credit: Alamy)Preparations for Euro 2024 might have taken a hit for Slovakia, with Calzona taking charge of Napoli alongside his role of Slovakia national team manager in February this year. Poor results in Naples won't have helped the Italian, either, who has previously worked at the club on a number of different occasions as assistant manager and technical coach. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Calzona did become the Slovakia national team boss in 2022, though, and has impressed so far in the role - not least of all because he managed to help the nation qualify for the Euros. Slovakia's star playerMilan SkriniarSlovakia captain Skriniar (Image credit: Getty Images)A rock in defence, Skriniar has proven his worth to both the national team and Inter Milan over a number of years. Having made the switch to PSG last summer, his stock has only risen, with the Slovak defender now an integral member of the French side.Though he suffered an ankle injury earlier in the season, the 29-year-old is back to full fitness and ready to keep out as many attacks with his snarling style of play and no-nonsense defending. FAQsHow many players are Slovakia allowed to take to Euro 2024?Slovakia will be allowed to take 26 players to Euro 2024, after UEFA announced in May that its initial decision to reduce team sizes had been reversed.
