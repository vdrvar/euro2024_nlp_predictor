England kickstart their Euro 2024 campaign with a difficult game against Serbia on Sunday, June 16, and the Three Lions are billed as the away side.Highlighted as the pre-tournament favourite to lift the Euro 2024 trophy, England will need to start strongly in the opening match if they're to go one better than their 2021 run to the final. Serbia themselves offer a real threat, too, with Al-Hilal duo Aleksandar Mitrovic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and captain Dusan Tadic all possessing the ability to cause a few problems. While four of the six third-placed teams will go into the knockout stages, meaning it isn't absolutely vital for Gareth Southgate's side to win, it's imperative the performance is strong to provide greater confidence for the remainder of their time in Germany. So what colour kit will England wear against Serbia? FourFourTwo delve into the detail below. What colour kit will England wear against Serbia?Phil Foden in the home kit (Image credit: Getty Images)Despite being drawn as the away side in their opening game, there's no danger of England wearing anything other than the classic white home kit at Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen.That's because home side Serbia will be playing in their traditional red strip, which has had a makeover ahead of the tournament to create something a little more ominious and intimidating for Mitrovic and Co.The England kit came under scrutiny when released (Image credit: Getty Images)The launch of England's home and away kit was met with a mixed reaction by fans, with some admiring the stylish ensemble, while others took exception to the 'playful update' on the St Geroge's cross on the collar of the home kit.Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The FA declared it a reimagination of "iconic kits from the past with a modern twist, making a bold statement with an eye-catching purple - a modern mix of classic blue and red England change kits of the past."More Euro 2024 storiesWith all the Euro 2024 kits now released, we at FourFourTwo tried our best to ascertain which was best, and which was worse, by ranking all 48 jerseys set to be donned in Germany this summer.Every fixture is set to be live at the tournament as well, so don't miss any of the action by finding out how to watch all the games from the comfort of your own home.
