The Romania Euro 2024 squad heads into the tournament full of confidence, having qualified with an unbeaten record and topping their group by five points ahead of runners-up Switzerland.Having featured at three European Championships this century, the Romania Euro 2024 squad may not be full of household names, though that won't exactly stop them challenging the very best. Tottenham defender Radu Dragusin is the most recognisable name in the team, but they've still got plenty of talented individuals elsewhere, such as captain Nicolae Stanciu, Ianis Hagi (son of Gheorge) and George Puscas.Romania have got lost time to make up for at Euro 2024, too, having failed to qualify for the last tournament despite matches being hosted in their capital city of Bucharest, as part of the pan-European Euros. The group stages will prove a difficult test, however, with Romania up against Belgium, Slovakia and Ukraine. The eastern European nation will fancy their chances under manager Edward Iordanescu, however, with the 45-year-old having galvanised the team since taking charge.FourFourTwo will also be covering every Euro 2024 squad at the tournament, bringing you all the latest on the group stages, how to watch each game and all the fixtures worth knowing about. Romania's squadRomania Euro 2024 squad: The squad for the March friendlies against Northern Ireland and ColombiaGK: Florin Nita (Gaziantep)GK: Horatiu Moldovan (Atletico Madrid)GK: Stefan Tarnovanu (FCSB)GK: Mihai Aioani (Rapid Bucuresti)DF: Andrei Burca (Al-Okhdood)DF: Ionut Nedelcearu (Palermo)DF: Cristian Manea (CFR Cluj)DF: Adrian Rus (Pafos FC)DF: Andrei Ratiu (Rayo Vallecano)DF: Deian Sorescu (Gaziantep)DF: Radu Dragusin (Tottenham)DF: Vasile Mogos (CFR Cluj)DF: Raul Oprut (Hermannstadt)DF: Bogdan Racovitan (Rakow Czestochowa)MF: Nicolae Stanciu (Damac)MF: Razvan Marin (Empoli)MF: Alexandru Cicaldau (Konyaspor on loan from Galatasaray)MF: Ianis Hagi (Alaves on loan from Rangers)MF: Dennis Man (Parma)MF: Valentin Mihaila (Parma)MF: Darius Olaru (FCSB)MF: Marius Marin (Pisa)MF: Olimpiu Morutan (Ankaragucu)MF: Florinel Coman (FCSB)MF: Denis Dragus (Gaziantep on loan from Standard Liege)MF: Adrian Sut (FCSB)FW: George Puscas (Bari on loan from Genoa)FW: Denis Alibec (Muaither)FW: Florin Tanase (Al-Okhdood)Romania Euro 2024 squad numbersThe Romania Euro 2024 squad numbers will be announced at a date closer to the tournament kicking off.Romania manager: Edward IordanescuEdward Iordanescu, Romania manager (Image credit: Alamy)Following in the footsteps of his father, Anghe, who managed the Romanian national team on three different occasions, Edward Iordanescu took over in 2022 following a string of spells in charge of various Romanian and Bulgarian club sides.

Qualifying unbeaten for the Euros is certainly an achievement not to be sniffed at, either. Romania's star playerRadu DragusinRadu Dragusin in action (Image credit: Getty Images)Dragusin made a winter switch from Genoa to Tottenham this season, and has impressed in the opportunities he has had under Ange Postecoglou. While Mickey van de Ven remains ahead of him in the pecking order, he's a solid defender whenever drafted in, with his passing out from the back impeccable.Romania will need Dragusin to be defensively sound this summer if they are to progress, though the attacking talent of Razvan Marin is also essential to their chances.FAQsHow many players are Romania allowed to take to Euro 2024?The Romania Euro 2024 squad will be made up of 26 players, an increase on the 23-player teams UEFA initially wanted for the tournament in Germany. Forutnately, UEFA changed its mind in May, announcing squads will be made up of 26 players.
