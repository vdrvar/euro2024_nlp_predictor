FourFourTwo Verdict


 
 
 
 



Often described as underrated in the past, New Balance has proven with the Furon V7+ Pro that this assumption is unfair: the brand is creating boots that are high in quality, and deliver in all the same performance areas as the other big-hitters on the market.

Pros
+Soft knitted upper+Something different
Cons
-Awkward sizing 


The New Balance Furon V7+ Pro is the latest offering from the American brand in their most established model, and it certainly delivers on performance, looks and feel.Having developed a reputation as one of the best boots of its type on the market, and a genuine alternative to speed boots like the Nike Mercurial Superfly and Adidas X Crazyfast, the Furon V7+ Pro is a slight update on the V7, with New Balance opting to release a refined version of the successful predecessor rather than a total revamp.The result is an improvement, helping produce an even more attractive package. I was able to try a pair in FG on grass to make a full judgement on the New Balance Furon V7+ Pro.New Balance Furon Pro V7 Plus (Silver) at Pro:Direct Sport for £126New Balance Furon V7+ Pro reviewNew Balance Furon V7+ Pro (Image credit: Future)As with the Furon V7, the upper of the Furon V7+ Pro is made up of Hypoknit, New Balance’s soft knit material. This material is also used on the brand's other elite boot, the Tekela V4+ Pro. However, here there is an even softer, slightly thinner layer of Hypoknit on the upper - making them something I truly loved playing in. The result is a boot that is even more comfortable out of the box and allows your foot to feel that bit closer to the ball for that uninterrupted contact. What's more, they're also lightweight, making them a great option for speedy wingers and strikers wanting a barefoot, weightless feel. Comfort is also improved by the heel area being curved, which feels slightly more anatomical. This helped lock down my feet into the boot, which is pretty good all round. Utilsing an off-centred lacing system, the Furon has a large striking area for clean shots at goal and midfielders looking to rake longer passes across the pitch. As can be expected of a low-profile boot of this type, the New Balance Furon V7+ Pro is narrow and fits fairly snugly, though there is still enough volume to make them accommodating for players with slightly wider feet. For those with especially wide feet, New Balance are unique in the football boot market in offering wide fit options for all of their boots, so this is worth exploring for those who struggle to fit into speed boots that tend to be built on the slimmer side. New Balance Furon V7+ Pro (Image credit: Future)The texturing throughout the upper has also changed from the Furon V7, but on both the V7 and the V7+ this is mainly cosmetic rather than having any real effect on the ball like the texturing we see on the uppers of other pairs. When it comes to the soleplate, it's simple but effective. Featuring heavily angled, chevron studs, there's plenty of bite in the traction when taking off at speed and the plate itself has good responsiveness with the kind of energy return that makes for a good speed boot.I wore these on natural grass, and from my experience believe this is the only surface that these are safe to wear on. The aggressive stud pattern is wholly unsuitable for artificial ground, and playing with these on that surface would come with significant injury risk. New Balance do also offer a dedicated AG option, so this is worth considering if you primarily play on these surfaces. New Balance Furon V7+ Pro (Image credit: Future)I would recommend going at least a half size up for the best fit with the Furon V7+. I wore my pair at a half size up and although they fit very snugly, this was still the best option for me. The sizing for New Balance pair does seem to diverge pretty dramatically from other brands so it is worth trying before buying. Indeed, I think the best fit for me would have been somewhere between a half size and full size larger than my usual.Overall, New Balance continue to go from strength to strength thanks to consistently improving on good quality football boots, helping them close the gap to the dominant brands in the market. These improvements do not go unnoticed, and curious consumers looking for an alternative to the status quo are becoming increasingly likely to opt for a pair such as the New Balance Furon V7+ Pro. More football boot reviewsSkechers SKX 01 review: Harry Kane's new boot sponsor entered the market with a bang, but are they any good?Adidas Predator Elite review: Upgraded both aesthetically and for performance, the latest version could be its best everNike Phantom GX Elite review: Can these football boots improve your touch on the ball?New Balance Furon Pro V7 Plus: Price Comparison£126View£175View£175ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by
