Across his career James has interviewed the likes of Franco Baresi, Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Michael Owen. James has been a Fulham season ticket holder since the mid-1990s and enjoys watching them home and away, through promotion and relegation.Matthew KetchellSocial Links NavigationDeputy EditorKetch joined FourFourTwo as Deputy Editor in 2022 having wracked up appearances at Reach PLC as a Northern Football Editor and BBC Match of the Day magazine as their Digital Editor and Senior Writer. During that time he has interviewed the likes of Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero, Gareth Southgate and attended World Cup and Champions League finals. He co-hosts a '90s football podcast called ‘Searching For Shineys’, is a Newcastle United season ticket holder and has an expensive passion for collecting classic football shirts.Anthony MooreSocial Links NavigationArt directorAnth Moore is the Group Art Director of FourFourTwo.

In the time between he plied his trade as both a writer and presenter on YouTube, earning the dubious distinction of being “The James Milner of WhatCulture”, as he was capable of playing any role, or just because it felt like he’d been around forever, depends on who you ask. And yes, that is him from the Football Manager documentary and, no, he doesn’t want to talk about it.Ed McCambridgeSocial Links NavigationStaff writerEd McCambridge is a staff writer at FourFourTwo, working across the magazine and website. A German speaker, he’s been working as a football reporter in Berlin since 2015, predominantly covering the Bundesliga and Germany's national team.

From in-depth interviews with the biggest names in the game, to longform features shining a light on the sport's most incredible stories and our unparalleled annual season previews, FFT has become a staple of the football landscape.But both our content and our values have always been driven by the fact that we are first-and-foremost football fans. We know that following football is an increasingly expensive pastime – from tickets, to merchandise, to TV subscriptions – so when we recommend a product, we really mean it.Affiliate & Advertising disclosureWe always aim to provide unbiased editorial created by our journalists and writers.
