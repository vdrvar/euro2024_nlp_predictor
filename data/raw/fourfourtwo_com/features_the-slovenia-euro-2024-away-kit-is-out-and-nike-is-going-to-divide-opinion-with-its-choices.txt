Where to buy








The Slovenia Euro 2024 away kit has been released by Nike, and there are some interesting design decisions.Most Euro 2024 kits are now out ahead of the tournament in Germany, highlighting just how teams will look at Euro 2024. There are plenty of beautiful designs available, while others have been dealt a poor hand by their respective manufacturers. Slovenia have received both a new home and away kit for the tournament, naturally, but a simple copy and paste job could anger some kit enthusiasts. The Slovenia Euro 2024 away kit will divide opinionBUY THE SHIRTSHOP NIKE KITS Buy this shirt from Nike.comThe Slovenia Euro 2024 away kit looks sharp, with a blue base combined with navy accents throughout the shirt. The same mountain element incorporated into the home kit is evident, as is the thick vertical stripe of tiny diamonds.While Nike could have certainly changed the design up, rather than the simple copy and paste job implemented here, it is still an interesting strip that will grab attention in Germany. Slovenia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike)SEE THE HOME(Image credit: Nike)EURO 2024 KITS Slovenia's Euro 2024 home kitThe kit is also added to the same Nike template as the home shirt, which makes it a little less interesting than it could have certainly become. Fans will either love or hate the design as a result.It's likely Slovenia will wear this kit at least once at Euro 2024, during their match against England. The pair meet in the final group stage match, with England classed as the home team by UEFA.  Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Buy the shirtSlovenia Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike)Nike Slovenia Euro 2024 away shirt   It's bold and brazen, but not that great to look atOur expert review:   SpecificationsColour: Blue/blackSize: XS-3XLToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Nice contrast between blue and blackReasons to avoid-Standard template could be substitutedMore kit dropsAdidas have dropped their Euro 2024 kits. Belgium's home kit is deep red, with a blue away kit on the cards, while Germany's home shirt and away shirt are both gorgeous. The Italy home shirt and away shirt, and Hungary's home shirt and away shirt are all minimal – as is the Spain home shirt, while their away shirt opts for a yellow/blue/red mix. Nike have released their shirts, too. France's home kit is brighter blue, while their away kit is pinstriped. The Netherlands home kit and away kit are both bolder than ever, while Portugal's last Nike home jersey and away kit are both guaranteed hits.Back in Blighty, England's home shirt is 80s-inspired, with the away shirt something brand new. Scotland's home shirt is a modern take on tartan while the away shirt is light blue/green. Wales haven't qualified yet – but have a classic home shirt and bright yellow away shirt.
