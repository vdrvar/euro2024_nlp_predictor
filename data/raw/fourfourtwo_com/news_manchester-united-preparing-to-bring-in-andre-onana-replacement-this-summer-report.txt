“What you see is he's progressing and I think he's doing very well lately, very good performances. So, he has to see this as a base and step up from here.”More Manchester United storiesTwo former Manchester United players have called for Erik ten Hag to be sacked after the humiliating defeat to Crystal Palace.Manchester United could be about to make €200m in transfer fees this summer from selling squad players. Only three stars are deemed to be untouchable at the club.
