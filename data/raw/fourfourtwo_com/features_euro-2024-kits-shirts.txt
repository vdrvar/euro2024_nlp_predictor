Euro 2024 kits have all dropped now, with the tournament set for shirt designs that will no doubt become iconic one day.With Euro 2024 around the corner, we now know what the official ball will look like, with every kit now released ahead of the competition's start date on June 14. Some of these will go down as the best football kits of the year, with the Euros providing a good template as to what the Premier League kits for 2024/25 will look like. So what will your country be wearing?All Euro 2024 kits released AlbaniaAlbania's kit (Image credit: Getty Images)Albania Euro 2024 home shirt   Nothing has been updated hereOur expert review:   SpecificationsColourway: Red/BlackSizes: N/AToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Cool collar+Red base works brilliantly with the crestThe Albania home kit for Euro 2024 is manufactured by Macron, but hasn't been exclusively designed for the tournament. Initially released in March 2023, Macron usually provide their teams with new kits every 24 months - meaning Albania will have to wait until March 2025 for a refresh.While a shame, with the Balkan nation competing in just their second-ever international tournament, at least it's still a nice design. With a deep red base and black collar, there's also a unique pattern bespoke to Albania featuring on the shirt. The Albania away kit is white (Image credit: Getty Images)Albania Euro 2024 away shirt    The same as the home shirt, just in a cleaner white colourwayOur expert review:    SpecificationsColourway: White/BlackSizes: N/AToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Albania crest pops against the white baseIn the exact same collar-design to the home shirt, the Albania Euro 2024 away kit has simply replaced the red for white on the kit.
