Every major tournament has a mascot, so what is the Euro 2024 mascot? Some are more memorable than others, but they can always be seen throughout host cities – at stadiums, press rooms, in fan zones and beyond. Mascots are often the face of the tournament, first appearing at European Championships since 1980 when Pinocchio was the character of choice for hosts Italy. Since then, a number of different animals and cartoon humans have traversed the summer landscape to help advertise the tournament - and Euro 2024 is no different.What is the Euro 2024 mascot?Albart at the UEFA congress in February (Image credit: Getty Images)Albart the bear is the furry friend of choice for Germany this summer, with the name winning a vote conducted on UEFA in 2023.Barnardo, Barnheart and Herzi von Bar - all of which are puns on the German word for bear - were all shortlisted, but Albart won with 32 per cent of the vote.Introduced to Germany fans ahead of the national team’s friendly game against Colombia last June, Albärt visited a primary school in Gelsenkirchen earlier that day.According to UEFA, Albärt's goal is about "highlighting an ambition to inspire children across Europe to get active and encourage a love of football and its values."Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Former Bayern Munich and Germany defender Phillip Lahm, who is the Euro 2024 tournament director, said of the bear: "As a parent, I know how important it is to stimulate children's imagination.

It's great to see UEFA inspiring the next generation to build self-confidence, live an active lifestyle and understand the importance team spirit – all important life lessons that will shape their future."This mascot will deliver that powerful message."More Euro 2024 storiesThe Euro 2024 squads are gearing up for the tournament in Germany, with the likes of England, Scotland, France and Italy all hoping for victory.
