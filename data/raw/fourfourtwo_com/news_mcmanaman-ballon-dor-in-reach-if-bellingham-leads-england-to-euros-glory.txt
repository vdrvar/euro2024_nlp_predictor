Former Real Madrid and England midfielder Steve McManaman believes Jude Bellingham would have a huge chance of winning this year's Ballon d'Or, if he guides England to European Championship success in Germany.Bellingham hit the ground running in his debut campaign at Real Madrid, scoring 19 goals in 28 La Liga matches to help Los Blancos to a 36th league title, then helping them to Champions League glory at Wembley.Yet to turn 21, Bellingham is arguably the star attraction in an England side littered with exciting young talent heading to Germany this summer, as critics eagerly watch on to see how the youngster deals with the pressure that comes with carrying the hopes of a nation.Bellingham is expected to play a key role under Gareth Southgate this summer. (Image credit: Getty Images)Bellingham's Ballon d'Or dreamHe has long been touted as a future Ballon d’Or winner. Since 2008, every recipient of the prize has played for Real Madrid except Lionel Messi. This year’s gong may not be out of reach if Bellingham can steer England to glory in Germany.“No, I don’t think it is,” McManaman told FourFourTwo. “Leo has gone, Cristiano has gone, so you’re looking for a brand new name on the trophy. If somebody scores a few goals at the Euros and lifts the cup, it could be them.“He plays in a different position to where he plays at Real Madrid, but Jude, Phil Foden and Harry Kane have all been in wonderful form this season,” adds McManaman. “England certainly have potential.”If Bellingham were to win the next Ballon d'Or, he'd be second youngest player ever to claim the award, behind Brazilian striker Ronaldo, pipping compatriot Michael Owen.Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The midfielder currently sits second in the bookies' favourites to win the award ahead of an undoubtedly influential summer of action.
