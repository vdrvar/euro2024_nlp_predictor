The Euro 2024 Golden Boot is going to be hotly contested, as some of Europe's most deadly strikers will be on show in Germany this summerWith 24 teams battling it out for the prize of being crowned Europe's best, Euro 2024 is set to begin on July 17 and will run for a month in what is expected to be a fiercely competitive tournament.Cristiano Ronaldo was the last recipient of the Golden Boot at Euro 2020. Will the 39-year-old do so again? FourFourTwo looks at seven other candidates who could rival one of the greatest of all time...Euro 2024 Golden Boot contenders1. Harry Kane (England)England captain Harry Kane missed out on the award at Euro 2020 and will be vowing for redemption (Image credit: Alamy)Club: Bayern Munich
Age: 30

Still banging them in as Bayern Munich stuttered, Kane will relish the chance to bolster his tumbleweedy trophy cabinet - one that does boast a World Cup Golden Boot, lest we forget. The Bundesliga's winter break, while most of his England team-mates were being flogged to dust, could help him to stay club-sharp for the whole tournament.2. Kylian Mbappe (France)Will Mbappe be distracted by a potential summer move at club level (Image credit: Getty Images)Club: PSG
Age: 25Moving house is stressful for the best of us. Bring down the personalised Louis Vuitton basketball hoop or just buy a new one?

Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)At 39, will this be the last time we see CR7 at a major international tournament? (Image credit: Getty Images)Club: Al Nassr
Age: 39Unlike Jordan Henderson (in so many ways), CR7 was pretty confident about keeping his Euros place despite plying his trade in the contentious Petrodollar Premier - 10 goals in qualifying backed that up.Portugal landed a sweet group draw, too, but Roberto Martinez loves to rotate mid-tournament-will that limit the pouting icon's quest for gold?Start your strop-watch now.4. Romelu Lukaku (Belgium)Romelu Lukaku has been in fine form for Roma in Serie A this season (Image credit: Getty Images)Club: Roma
Age: 30The semi-veteran Roma loanee - yes, somehow he still belongs to Chelsea - is no busted flush, having scored freely at the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020, then netted 14 goals in eight qualifiers here when the next-best haul was 10. But Rom wasn't remotely fit for Belgium's 2022 Qatarstrophe - what about now?5. Niclas FullkrugFullkrug has been on top form for Borussia Dortmund this term (Image credit: Getty Images)Club: Borussia Dortmund
Age: 31It's always nice to see a major nation's attack led by a bloke who resembles a painter-decorator (see also: Kane, H.) but, as Germany's top scorer over the past 12 months, Fullkrug deserves a bit more respect. Though it's unclear if he will start ahead of Kai Havertz, he did score twice from the bench in Qatar and has strengthened his claim since with great form in Europe and the Bundesliga. 6. Alvaro Morata (Spain)Alvaro Morata has also enjoyed a fruitful campaign  (Image credit: David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)Club: Atletico Madrid
Age: 31The Atletico Madrid man often appears mildly haunted by his stop-start career, yet he's the non-false nine Spain need in these post-tiki-taka times.Italy and Croatia won't offer much change in the group, but La Roja's skipper could score four against Albania and take the prize by accident. He's a decent outside bet.7. Rasmus Hojlund (Denmark)Hojlund has enjoyed a promising start to life in the Premier League (Image credit: Getty Images)Club: Manchester United
Age: 21This could be quite the end-of-season redemption story, given that Hojlund, pre-Christmas, apparently represented everything wrong with Manchester United's post-Fergie recruitment. Even then he was bagging goals in Europe, for club and country, and Denmark meet-ups must feel particularly hygge compared to the Old Trafford turmoil.8. Scott McTominay (Scotland)McTominay's goalscoring exploits for his nation have been remarkable (Image credit: Getty Images)Club: Manchester United
Age: 27An each-way outsider, Scotland's McTominay hit a magnificent seven in qualifying, more than Robert Lewandowski or Erling Haaland.Word to the wise: with that never-say-die spirit and eye for a late equaliser/winner, Manchester United's ultra-fit cowboy-jawed midfielder is always a good bet for last goalscorer.More Euro 2024 storiesEver Euro 2024 squad is on the verge of being announced, as nations step up their preparations for the tournament in Germany. All want to hit the ground running in their fixtures in the group stages, which are all available to watch extremely easily. While the golden boot contenders would all like to score the most come the end of the tournament, winning the final on July 14 remains the clear objective. There are some clear favourites expected to perform the best, however.
