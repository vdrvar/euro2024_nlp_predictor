Where to buy








The Slovenia Euro 2024 home kit is out, and there are reasons to both love and hate the new shirt.With nearly every Euro 2024 kit released ahead of the tournament in Germany, it's become a whole lot clearer how teams will look at Euro 2024. Some teams are going to be decked out in bespoke, beautiful strips - others, less so. Slovenia will be looking fresh in their new kit at least, but fans might have preferred a bit more care and attention placed into the design...The Slovenia Euro 2024 home kit is both brilliant and boring at the same timeBUY THE SHIRTSHOP NIKE KITS Buy this shirt from Nike.comThe Slovenia Euro 2024 home kit has a unique design element of a mountain stuck between the Swoosh and crest, highlighting the nation's mountainous region. Indeed, with around 90% of the surface of Slovenia is  200 meters or more above sea level.Below that, there's a thick, vertical stripe of tiny diamonds all stuck together in a uniform fashion. It's a shame it's not in a different colour to black, but the design is a lot different than others created by Nike, which is certainly a plus.It is still stuck on top of a basic Nike Vapor IV teamwear template, though, meaning there's still a lack of personality to the shirt. In FourFourTwo's opinion, each team really deserves a bespoke kit for the tournament, which Slovenia have only got half of. Nike Slovenia Euro 2024 home shirt (Image credit: Nike)SEE THE AWAY(Image credit: Nike)EURO 2024 KITS Slovenia's Euro 2024 away kitSlovenia will debut the new kit in warm-up games against Armenia and Bulgaria, prior to facing Denmark, Serbia and England at the Euros. It's likely they'll need to change to their away kit for the final game.Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Buy the shirtNike Slovenia Euro 2024 home shirt (Image credit: Nike)Nike Slovenia Euro 2024 home shirt   A unique design element added to a standard templateOur expert review:   SpecificationsColour: White/blackSize: XS-3XLToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Mountain element looks coolReasons to avoid-Standard template is a bit blandMore kit dropsAdidas have dropped their Euro 2024 kits. Belgium's home kit is deep red, with a blue away kit on the cards, while Germany's home shirt and away shirt are both gorgeous. The Italy home shirt and away shirt, and Hungary's home shirt and away shirt are all minimal – as is the Spain home shirt, while their away shirt opts for a yellow/blue/red mix. Nike have released their shirts, too. France's home kit is brighter blue, while their away kit is pinstriped. The Netherlands home kit and away kit are both bolder than ever, while Portugal's last Nike home jersey and away kit are both guaranteed hits.Back in Blighty, England's home shirt is 80s-inspired, with the away shirt something brand new. Scotland's home shirt is a modern take on tartan while the away shirt is light blue/green. Wales haven't qualified yet – but have a classic home shirt and bright yellow away shirt.
