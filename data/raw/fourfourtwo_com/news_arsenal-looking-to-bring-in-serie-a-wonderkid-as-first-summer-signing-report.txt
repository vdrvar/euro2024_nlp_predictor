His agent, Andrea Ritorni, has stated how clubs in England have asked about the availability of the teenager, but for now he remains focused in Serie A."Fiorentina need not worry," Ritorini said earlier this year."There is a contract that speaks for him: Michael is doing well with this club and in this team. Of course, various Premier teams follow him and have followed him."This interest is normal, it’s part of football and life. However, Fiorentina have tied him down with a nice contract and many bonuses."Let’s think about doing well now and in the future for the purple shirt."More Arsenal storiesArsenal legend vows to get Tottenham tattoo if Spurs beat Manchester CityArsenal identify top summer transfer target and start 'pushing' for deal: reportArsenal target former star in surprise deal that would solve two issues: report
