Where is the Euro 2024 final? You're probably wondering if you're as optimistic as we are at FourFourTwo, plotting your nation's route to ultimate glory.Euro 2024 will see 24 hopeful nations descend on Germany, all hoping, believing, expecting that they'll be the ones lifting the trophy come July 14. Of course, there can only be one winner, but that won't stop fans dreaming of a trip to the final. Germany has a plethora of brilliant stadiums to choose from to host the final, too. Making a decision over which city gets the most important game of all must not have been easy, but organsiers have fortunately managed to nail down where the greatest European prize for national teams will be awarded. Where is the Euro 2024 final?The Olympiastadion, as seen before Hertha Berlin vs Arminia Bielefeld in 2008 (Image credit: Thomas Starke/Bongarts/Getty Images)The Euro 2024 final will be held at the Olympiastadion, Berlin. With a capacity of 74,475, plenty of fans will be in attendance for the final no doubt creating a raucous atmosphere. Ranked at No.14 in FFT's list of the 100 greatest stadiums on Earth, Berlin's biggest ground was originally built for the controversial 1936 Summer Olympic Games and the scene of Jesse Owens' iconic gold medal haul. The stadium has undergone two extensive renovations in the meantime, once for the 1974 World Cup and again for the 2006 World Cup.For the first tournament, Johan Cruyff and Netherlands' total football team were beaten by Franz Beckenbauer's West Germany in the final, with Berlin's Olympiastadion hosting three games in the group stages. Munich's Olympiastadion had the honour of hosting the final, though Berlin would be granted the biggest game in football in 2006, when Italy and France took to the World Cup final – and infamously, Zinedine Zidane KO'd Marco Materazzi.That was the first time that technology was used in the World Cup final, actually, as the referee told by Gigi Buffon to look at the big screen and see what Zizou had just done to his team-mate.

(Image credit: John Madougall/AFP via Getty Images)Germany's opening match in the 2011 Women's World Cup was also played at the Olympiastadion, with the stadium hosting the 2015 Champions League final, too - the last time Barcelona triumphed in the competition. 2. Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin have played their matches at the Olympiastadion since 1963, too, while the German Cup final has been played there every year since 1985. Hertha's rivals and smaller neighbours Union Berlin borrowed the hulking great Olympic stadium for their Champions League fixtures, this season as well, given that their own Stadion An der Alten Forsterei does not comply with UEFA regulations for Champions League stadiums. Alongside hosting the final, it's set to host five Euro 2024 fixtures, including a quarter-final, round of 16 match, plus Spain vs Croatia, Poland vs Austria, and Netherlands vs Austria in the Group Stage of the competition.Munich's Allianz Arena and Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park are set to host the semi-finals of Euro 2024. More Euro 2024 storiesWhile the favourites will all be hoping to reach the final of Euro 2024, they'll first need to get through some tricky fixtures in the opening stages of the tournament. It's possible to watch all 51 games at the tournament quite easily, though, with each nation's kits set to stand out across Germany this summer.  The squads are close to being finalised, too, with Gareth Southgate's England side and Steve Clarke's Scotland team all coming together nicely ahead of the tournament.
