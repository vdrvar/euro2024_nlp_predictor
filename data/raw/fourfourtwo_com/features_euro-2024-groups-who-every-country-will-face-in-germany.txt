The Euro 2024 groups were drawn back in December, with 24 countries forming six different pools this year.Following the play-offs in March, the Euro 2024 groups are now complete, with Poland, Georgia and Ukraine all progressing to the finals in Germany. Each nation, therefore, knows exactly who their opponents will be this summer, as they all look to reach the knockout stages of the tournament.Only eight sides will be eliminated in the group stages, too. In each of the six groups of four, the top two will progress, while the four best third-placed teams will also qualify for the knockout rounds. Here, FourFourTwo runs the rule over all six groups.Euro 2024 groupsGroup AHosts Germany headline Group A (Image credit: Getty Images)GermanyScotlandHungarySwitzerlandGroup A is where Euro 2024 all begins, with hosts Germany taking on Scotland in Munich on Friday 14 June. After failing at the first hurdle in World Cup 2022, Germany will want to put right their wrongs on this occasion by making things easier for themselves with a win against Scotland. That might not be as straightforward as it sounds, though, with Steve Clarke's men full of confidence after a strong qualifying campaign. And though Germany will be favourites to top the group, Euros regulars Switzerland and an ascendant Hungary team will also fancy their chances of causing an upset on Die Mannschaft's home soil.Group BCan Italy emulate Group B opponents Spain to become just the second team to retain the Euros? (Image credit: Getty Images)SpainCroatiaItalyAlbaniaThe proverbial Group of Death, Group B is stacked full of heavy hitters all ready to slog it out across each of their three matches. Featuring holders Italy, two-time European champions Spain, World Cup 2018 finalists and World Cup 2022 semi-finalists Croatia, and supposed group whipping boys Albania - though don't be surprised to see the Balkan nation shock their rivals. After all, none of the other three sides are quite as good as their recent history suggests: Italy failed to qualify for the most recent World Cup after winning the Euros, Spain are a side in transition with few household names, and Croatia's most talented stars (Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic, Marcelo Brozovic) are all ageing and past their best. Arguably, that makes it all the more fixating. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Group CEngland are among the favourites this summer (Image credit: Getty Images)SloveniaDenmarkSerbiaEnglandEngland's bid to end [checks notes] 58 years of hurt and win their first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup (and their first Euros) begins in Group C – which they start as clear favourites.Among the Three Lions' opponents are Denmark, who they dramatically beat in extra time to reach the final of Euro 2020. Can the Danes bounce back from the disappointment of an early exit at the 2022 World Cup and produce another strong Euros showing?Completing the Group C line-up are Serbia – appearing on this stage for the first time since Euro 2000, when they competed as FR Yugoslavia – and Slovenia, back in a major tournament for the first time since the 2010 World Cup.Group DWill France talisman Kylian Mbappe turn it on at a major finals once more? Probably (Image credit: Getty Images)PolandNetherlandsAustriaFrancePredicting this foursome could prove extremely difficult. While France are the clear standouts to top this group, Netherlands, Austria and Poland are all strong sides in their own right and could topple Les Bleus if they fail to hit top form in German.The previous Euros highlighted that's certainly a possibility, too, with their shock last-16 exit to Switzerland on penalties proving they're not infallible. Still, they do have Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann in their side, so it's a tall order to suggest all their results will go against them. A relatively youthful Netherlands team will also be hoping to go well in Germany, having not progressed beyond the last eight of the Euros for 20 years, while Ralf Rangnick's Austria could be one to watch. In what is likely Robert Lewandowski's final international tournament, could the Barcelona striker inspire his nation to the last 16? Group EBelgium enter Euro 2024 looking to bounce back from their miserable 2022 World Cup group stage exit (Image credit: Getty Images)BelgiumSlovakiaRomaniaUkraineIn what is a relatively open-looking group, Group E is headlined by a Belgium team who've moved into a new era under Domenico Tedesco. No Eden Hazard, no Jan Vertonghen, no Toby Alderweireld - but they've still got Kevin De Bruyne. The highest-ranked nation of this four, they'll be expected to top the table.Slovakia are will be aiming to make the last 16 for the second time as they appear at their third Euros (in succession), while Romania have kept up their record of qualifying for alternate Euros since 2000.Ukraine will also be competing at the tournament, and will prove tricky customers with Oleksandr Zinchenko and La Liga top scorer Artem Dovbyk among their ranks. Group FCristiano Ronaldo will captain Portugal once more at what seems likely to be his final tournament (Image credit: Getty Images)TurkeyGeorgiaPortugalCzech RepublicGroup H of Euro 2024 will feature two former European champions, with 2016 winners Portugal and 1976 winners the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia) taking part.Portugal, now coached by former Belgium boss Roberto Martinez, are among the bookies' favourites to lift the trophy, with skipper Cristiano Ronaldo preparing for what, at the age of 39, will surely be his major tournament swansong.The Portuguese posted a 100% record in qualifying, while Turkey also won their group – and they'll have their sights set on a decent showing in Germany after limping out at the first hurdle of Euro 2020, where they were considered dark horses. Georgia will also be at the tournament, after beating Greece.More on Euro 2024 from FourFourTwoAll Euro 2024 squads are close to being finalised, with UEFA announcing that teams will be allowed to select 26 players. It's possible to watch all 51 games at the tournament quite easily, with each nation's kits set to stand out across their fixtures in Germany this summer.
