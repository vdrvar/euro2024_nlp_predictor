Where to buy








The Poland Euro 2024 away kit features a futuristic design, with Nike going for a bold choice ahead of the tournament.With the Netherlands, Austria and France awaiting in the Euro 2024 group stages, it's highly unlikely Poland will be wearing anything other than their white home kit. However, anything can happen if they manage to reach the knockouts of Euro 2024, meaning their controversial away kit could come into play. All Euro 2024 kits have now been confirmed ahead of the tournament, and Poland's away will catch the attention if it's used. The Poland Euro 2024 away kit is bold - but not necessarily greatBUY THE SHIRTSHOP NIKE KITS Buy this shirt from Nike.comRed has been the staple colour of Poland away kits for eternity it feels like, with Nike's 2010 navy effort the only time the base has moved away from red. But while that remains in the newest iteration of the away shirt, Nike have tried something a whole lot bolder.Incorporating three red tones layered together to provide a gradient effect, there's a bold graphic created on the Poland away shirt. It stops on the back of the shirt - apart from the bottom quarter - to ensure the player's name and number are more legible, but it's a futuristic choice that has never been tried before for Poland.Nike Poland Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike/Poland)SEE THE HOME(Image credit: Nike/Poland)EURO 2024 KITS Poland's Euro 2024 home kitLike the home kit, the crest is oversized, too, with a white border added to really help it pop out of the shirt. The Nike Swoosh is placed just below, while the Polish Football Federation's logo features on the back of the neck.The collar is different to the home, though, with a simple round-neck incorporated onto the away jersey. This does give it the feel somewhat of a training top, especially when considering the graphic pattern throughout. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nike Poland Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike/Poland)Whether Robert Lewandowski and his team-mates pull this kit on remains to be seen. Buy the shirtPoland Euro 2024 away kit (Image credit: Nike/Poland)Nike Poland Euro 2024 away shirt   A futuristic design choice in a first for the nationOur expert review:   SpecificationsColour: Bright Crimson/Gym Red/Team Red/WhiteSize: XS-XXXLToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonVisit SiteReasons to buy+Three-tone red graphic+Centralised crest and logoMore kit dropsNike have released all of their shirts, after Adidas dropped theirs.Belgium's home kit is a deeper red, with their away kit Tintin-inspired. Germany's home jersey and away jersey have gradient-style patterns, while Italy's home shirt and away shirt and Hungary's home kit and away kit are more subtle. The Spain home shirt and away shirt are both inspired by nature. France's home kit and away kit are brighter than recent moody efforts, as is the Netherlands home kit. The away kit, meanwhile, is more artistic: and Portugal have similar: their last Nike home jersey is a lighter red, with their away kit inspired by art.For Britain, England's home kit and away kit visit different ends of a spectrum. Scotland's home shirt is modern and brash while the away shirt is calmer in tone. Wales are yet to qualify – but their home shirt and away shirt are both safe options.
