Euro 2024: What could England's route to the final look like?

England are targeting Euro 2024 success this summer, having come close in the last few international tournaments - but what could their potential route to the final be? After near misses at World Cups 2018 and 2022, as well as Euro 2020, the Three Lions head into Euro 2024 as one of the tournament favourites due to the strength of their squad. Players such as Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Declan Rice have all been standout performers for their clubs this season, and if they manage to translate that onto the international stage then the Three Lions will stand in good stead to reach the final.But first, Gareth Southgate's side will have to overcome Denmark, Serbia and Slovenia in the group stages, before then finding out their potential opponents in the knockout rounds. With four of the six teams finishing third in the groups progressing to the last 16, though, how the tournament will pan out isn't entirely clear at this early stage. Regardless, England will be confident of escaping Group C with relative ease. In doing so, they'd set up potentially easier ties on the way to the final, though it's always difficult to predict. With that being said, here is a look at England's possible path to glory in Germany next year...VIDEO: All You Need To Know About Euro 2024What could England's route to the Euro 2024 final look like?If England finish top of Group CBellingham will be a crucial player this summer (Image credit: Getty Images)England will be expected to finish top of Group C and if they do, they will set up a last-16 tie against the best third-placed team from Group D, E or F.Group D includes Poland, Netherlands, Austria and France, Group E contains Belgium, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, while Group F is comprised of Turkey, Georgia, Portugal, Czech Republic. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.On paper, it seems that Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, therefore, are the most likely sides England could face, though that depends on the amount of points each third-place team in the tournament finishes with. Of course, that could all be subject to change - Portugal finished third in their group at Euro 2016 before going on to lift the trophy, so nothing is set in stone.If England manage to make it through the last 16 unscathed, they'd then face a quarter-final against either the runner-up of Group A or runner-up of Group B. Germany, Scotland, Hungary and Switzerland are in the former, while Spain, Croatia, Italy and Albania make up Group B. That means the Three Lions could have a chance at redemption against Italy, following their painful Euro 2020 final loss, though any of the aforementioned teams could feasibly be opponents in the final eight this summer. After that, it's likely the winner of either Group D or E awaits, meaning a possible semi-final meeting with France, England's conquerors in last year's World Cup quarter-final in Qatar. Les Bleus won that last-eight clash 2-1 and Harry Kane missed a penalty to bring the scores level. Belgium are also potential opponents. Get through that one and England could face Germany, Spain or Portugal in the final.If England finish second in Group CThe England squad is stacked full of talent (Image credit: Getty Images)If England finish as runners-up in their group, their route to the final will be made more difficult. In the last 16 they'd face the winner of Group A, likely tournament hosts Germany. A win would see them progress to a quarter-final tie against either the winner of Group B (Spain, Croatia, Italy or Albania) or the third-placed team from Group A/D/E/F - meaning there are plenty of potential opponents dependent on permutations. And if the Three Lions advance to the semi-finals on this path, Gareth Southgate's side could face a semi-final clash with the winner of Group F, or the runner-up of Group D or E. That could set up a clash with Netherlands or Portugal for a place in the showpiece game in Berlin on July 14th.Victory in their semi-final would then likely set up a final against France.If England finish third in Group CEngland can still progress by finishing third (Image credit: Getty Images)Here's where things become a lot less certain. While finishing third is far from ideal, it doesn't mean immediate elimination from the tournament. Instead, it relies on waiting to see how every other group pans out, with the four teams with the best points total who finished third reaching the knockout stages. At Euro 2020, three points and -1 goal difference was enough for Ukraine to qualify for the next round, while Northern Ireland and Portugal both progressed at Euro 2016 with three points and a goal difference of 0. Four points, therefore, should secure a spot in the last 16, while three points poses a risk.Should England finish as one of the best-ranked third-place teams, they'll come up against either the winner of Group E or F - likely Belgium of Portugal, depending on results elsewhere. Those paths are on opposite sides of the draw, however, meaning it's possible England come up against the winner of Group D (potentially France) or the runner-up of Group D or E (perhaps the Netherlands or Ukraine) in the quarters. If they reach the semis, then expect a difficult opponent regardless of which side of the draw they're on. More Euro 2024 storiesEach team's home and away kits are now confirmed ahead of the tournament, while the official match ball and stadiums are all clear, too. Missing a single minute of the action isn't an option this summer, either, once you find out how to watch every Euro 2024 game, with all the squads gearing up for the tournament.
