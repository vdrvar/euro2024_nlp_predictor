(Image credit: Adam Davy)Southgate's potential appointment at Manchester United has caused quite the stir between several former players and current pundits.Roy Keane recently suggested that he would be happy for the current England boss to manage United, given that he has previously worked with soon-to-be appointed sporting director Dan Ashworth.

Speaking on the Stick to Football Podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, Keane said: "I could see that happening. Well, obviously everyone’s thinking he’s probably going to be with England this summer if he has a good championship, thinking if they could win it."And if they don’t, then maybe they’re thinking maybe you’ve ran your race with him. His connection with Dan Ashworth, who he has worked with previously. Yeah, I’m not that surprised with it."

Former Arsenal forward Ian Wright agreed with the words echoed by Keane, saying: "I see Gareth Southgate standing on the line and the way he will be dressed and his demeanour. I could see him, he’s got the stature to be Manchester United manager the way he is.

"For Gareth, talking about someone who looks the part, he’ll probably look the part standing on the line for Manchester United."More Manchester United storiesManchester United to axe four huge earners in summer mass exodus: report

Our mission is to offer our intelligent, international audience access to the game’s biggest names, insightful analysis... and a bit of a giggle. We unashamedly love this game and we hope that our coverage reflects that.
