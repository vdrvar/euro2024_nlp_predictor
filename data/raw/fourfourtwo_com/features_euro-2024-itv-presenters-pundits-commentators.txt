Euro 2024 is only a matter of months away – which means the big broadcasters are assembling their teams of for this summer's major tournament in Germany.ITV, along with the BBC, have the rights to show Euro 2024 games in the UK, and the broadcaster is expected to select a line-up of presenters, pundits and commentators befitting an international tournament hosted in Germany. Here, we run through all the faces (and voices) involved this summer...ITV's Euro 2024 PresentersMark PougatchPougatch has been at ITV since 2015 (Image credit: Getty Images)Mark Pougatch has been in broadcasting since the early 90s, taking over as ITV’s sports anchor in 2015 – having previously worked extensively for the BBC.Expect to see Pougatch fronting coverage of all the big games on ITV at Euro 2024, including any involving England and the final (which may not be mutually exclusive).Laura WoodsWoods has a rich presenting background (Image credit: Getty Images)Laura Woods anchored ITV’s coverage of the 2023 Women’s World Cup, having also presented games for the channel at the 2022 World Cup.The main host of talkSPORT’s breakfast show between 2020 and 2023, away from football, Woods has covered darts and NFL.Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from

PostecoglouTottenham boss Postecoglou (Image credit: Getty Images)The Tottenham Hotspur boss will offer a contemporaneous manager’s eye on the Euros, and is well-placed to comment on both England and Scotland having managed Celtic to great success before making the move to London last summer.Postecoglou had a brief international career in his playing days, earning four caps for Australia between 1986 and 1988, but can bring major tournament management experience to the table too having managed his country at the 2014 World Cup and the 2015 Asian Cup.Danny Rohl Danny Rohl, manager of Sheffield Wednesday (Image credit: Getty Images)A former assistant manager at RB Leipzig, Southampton, Bayern Munich and – most pertinently to this summer – the German national team under Hansi Flick, Rohl took over at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday last October with the club without a win from their first 11 games.The German has attracted no shortage of admirers at Hillsborough, overcoming a rocky introduction to senior management and overseeing a significant improvement to pull them clear of the bottom three.Roy KeaneKeane is often a fan-favourite (Image credit: Getty Images)Manchester United and Republic of Ireland legend Roy Keane took no prisoners on the pitch – and he’s taken a similarly tough approach to punditry.That’s made him one of the best in the business, though, and has been a frequent fixture in the ITV studio at each of the last three major tournaments.Ian WrightWright is adored by ITV viewers (Image credit: Getty Images)Hugely popular as a player and pundit, Arsenal icon Ian Wright is one of ITV’s go-to guys for coverage of Euros and World Cups.Capped 33 times by England, Wrighty is also a regular on Match of the Day during the Premier League season.Gary NevilleNeville is regularly seen on punditry duty (Image credit: Getty Images)One of Sky Sports’ top co-commentators, Gary Neville tends to turn his hand to studio punditry when international tournaments come around.The former Manchester United right-back helped England to the semi-finals of Euro 96 on home turf, and also appeared at Euro 2000 and Euro 2004.Karen CarneyCarney became a pundit after retiring (Image credit: Getty Images)Capped 144 times by England, Karen Carney won multiple top-flight titles with Arsenal as a player, in addition to the Women’s FA Cup with the Gunners and Chelsea.Since moving into broadcasting in 2020, Carney has covered the FA Cup and 2022 World Cup for ITV.Eni AlukoAluko moved into punditry five years ago (Image credit: Getty Images)Eni Aluko has been among ITV’s foremost pundits at recent international tournaments, carving out a successful broadcasting career since retiring from playing in 2019.A 102-time England international, Aluko won trophies with Chelsea, Juventus, Birmingham City and Charlton Athletic.Graeme SounessSouness returns to TV screens (Image credit: Getty Images)A former Scotland international with Liverpool and Rangers on his CV both as a player and manager who was a regular pundit on Sky Sports until last year, Souness will be familiar to football fans of all ages.A tough-tackling but extremely classy midfielder with a sizeable medal collection, Souness played at the 1978, 192 and 1986 World Cups, but never played at a Euros with Scotland not qualifying for the first time until 1992.Christina UnkelChristina Unkel used to referee (Image credit: Getty Images)An American former referee turned analyst, Unkel has been a regular face on CBS’ soccer coverage in the United States as a refereeing analyst – the same role she will fulfil for ITV.Unkel is also the president of brand-new club Tampa Bay Sun, who will compete in the new-look American women’s second tier when it gets under way later this year.ITV's Euro 2024 CommentatorsSam MatterfaceMatterface has been the lead ITV commentator for a number of years (Image credit: Getty Images)ITV’s lead football commentator since 2020, Sam Matterface will be the man behind the mic for all of the biggest Euro 2024 matches on the channel – including any England games.Previously a presenter on Sky Sports News, Matterface has also provided commentary for reality show Dancing on Ice.Seb HutchinsonSeb Hutchinson  (Image credit: Getty Images)Still a relative newcomer, Seb Hutchinson has made waves with his commentary on the Premier League and major international tournaments.Formerly a TV producer, Hutchinson – who was part of ITV’s team at the 2022 World Cup and 2023 Women’s World Cup had dreamed of becoming a commentator since he was a child.Clive TyldesleyTyldesley is an iconic commentator (Image credit: Getty Images)A real stalwart of the gantry, Clive Tyldesley’s voice is as recognisable as they come in the world of football commentary.Hugely popular with fans, he’s been calling the action for ITV since 1998 – when he succeeded the great Brian Moore.Pien MeulensteenPien Meulensteen (Image credit: Getty Images)The Dutch-born, British-raised commentator is one of broadcasting’s rising talents, ascending from MUTV to Match of the Day and Sky Sports’ coverage of the Premier League.This is far from Meulensteen’s first rodeo at a major international tournament: she covered the 2022 World Cup for the BBC and last year’s Women’s World Cup for ITV. And yes, she is Rene Meulensteen’s daughter, if you had wondered.Joe SpeightJoe Speight has commentated for ITV at three Euros and three World Cups, beginning with Euro 2012.Other competitions he has covered include the Champions League, Africa Cup of Nations and Bundesliga.ITV's Euro 2024 co-commentatorsAlly McCoistAlly McCoist  (Image credit: Getty Images)Probably the most popular co-commentator in the game, Ally McCoist just LOVES football – and his infectious enthusiasm for the game livens up every broadcast.Usually paired up with Jon Champion, the ex-Rangers and Scotland striker has further endeared himself to viewers with his impromptu in-match history lessons.Lee DixonLee Dixon (Image credit: Getty Images)As a player, Lee Dixon won four English top-flight titles and three FA Cups with Arsenal – in addition to earning 22 caps for England.Previously a regular on the BBC’s Match of the Day 2 and Football Focus, the former right-back is Sam Matterface’s main colleague on the ITV gantry.Andros TownsendAndros Townsend (Image credit: Getty Images)The former England international will shake off the disappointment of Luton Town’s relegation to the Championship to head out to Germany and join ITV’s co-commentary team.Winger Townsend represented England 13 times from 2013-2016, when he was at Tottenham and Newcastle, but did not quite make the cut for Roy Hodgson’s squad for the 2014 World Cup or Euro 2016.More Euro 2024 storiesEURO 2024 SQUADS All the teams previewedEURO 2024 FAVOURITES Best odds on nation to win European Championship in GermanyEURO 2024 WALL CHART Free to download with full schedule and dates
