How Arsenal's Martin Odegaard Just DESTROYED Chelsea


Arsenal 5-0 Chelsea and Mikel Arteta's men look like taking the Premier League title race all the way to the wire. But while praise has been heaped upon Kai Havertz for his two goals against his former club, it was actually his captain who was the architect behind the Gunners emphatic victory over their London rivals. Adam Clery looks at Martin Odegaard's performance, and his season in general, to make a case for him being the Premier League's Player of the Year.





 










Why Man United's Biggest Problem Is... Erik Ten Hag


Manchester United were a toenail away from arguably the most humiliating defeat in FA Cup history. But despite the manager's assertions that their victory should be celebrated, Coventry City showed four times precisely what is wrong with Erik Ten Hag's management... and why he'll not be able to fix it. FourFourTwo's Adam Clery unpacks the match as a whole, and says it might be time for the Dutchman to move on.





 








Why Man City DOMINATED Real Madrid (But Couldn't Win)


Manchester City 1-1 Real Madrid on the night but it's an early Champions League exit for Pep Guardiola's side all the same. But why, despite playing well and creating some big chances against the Spanish giants, did City fail to win the game? Adam Clery examines the game, finds how City were able to get on top, but also breaks down why they couldn't make it count.





 








How Cole Palmer Just DESTROYED Everton


Cole Palmer bagged an incredible FOUR goals in Chelsea's demolition of Everton, taking him to the very top of the Premier League scoring charts. Putting aside the tension with Nicholas Jackson and Noni Madueke over the penalty, the game neatly illustrated just why he's had such an incredible first season under Mauricio Pochettino. Adam Clery looks at the goals, the player, and the numbers, to show just how special a player he's already become.

RETRO TACTICS EPISODE 2 Team: Arsenal FC Manager: Arsene Wenger Era: Premier League Season 2003/4 In the second installment of our Retro Tactics series, we look at arguably the greatest team to ever grace the English top-flight, Arsene Wenger's Arsenal 'Invincibles'. 38 games, 1 Premier League trophy, and 0 defeats, this was arguably where the North London side (and football itself) peaked. Key Players: Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Sol Campbell, Dennis Bergkamp, Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires. Honours: Premier League 03/04 (undefeated).





 








Trent Alexander-Arnold: Why I KNEW Moving Into Liverpool's Midfield Would Work


There’s been plenty of noise around Trent Alexander-Arnold’s performances for club and country over the past 12 months, but the man himself has maintained a cool head. Donning a retro shellsuit for FFT, the Merseyside maestro insists he still has lofty ambitions – none more so than becoming the best player in the world. We spent an hour with him at a secret location in his hometown of West Derby where we talked about his ambitions at Liverpool, his role for England, and whether or not he could see himself managing one day.

'I fell in love with football as I was later to fall in love with women: Suddenly. Inexplicably. Uncritically. Giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring with it': Nick Hornby, Fever Pitch


By

Bill Borrows

INTERVIEW
Nothing speaks to fandom like Hornby's 1992 classic, published when Highbury was crumbling and football literature amounted to little more than your matchday programme. Thirty years later, FFT grabs lunch with the author himself to chew the pasta over Arsenal, Fever Pitch's legacy, the wider game - and just a touch more Arsenal...
