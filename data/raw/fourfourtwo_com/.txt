Why Kieran McKenna's Ipswich Are PERFECT For The Premier League


Ipswich Town have reached the Premier League for the first time in over two decades. What's more they've done so while building an incredible reputation for open, dynamic, attacking football. It's invited all manner of speculation of boss Kieran McKenna's future, but Adam Clery looks at his side to assess exactly why the Premier League might be in for a rude awakening when the Tractor Boys arrive next season.





 










How Crystal Palace Just DESTROYED Man United


Crystal Palace piled the misery on Erik Ten Hag, smashing 4 goals past Manchester United in their biggest defeat of the season. But while the inquest begins at Old Trafford, the result won't have surprised anyone who has been keeping an eye on the Eagles in recent weeks. Under Oliver Glasner, they're starting to look like a very, very good side.





 








Why It's All Going Wrong For Spurs


Tottenham fell to another defeat this weekend. Liverpool the latest to pile the misery on Spurs after Arsenal, Chelsea, and Newcastle had all taken 3 points against them. But with murmurings of discontent starting to form against both the players and the manager, Adam Clery examines their last 4 games to see precisely what the problem is and if they can fix it.





 








Why Liverpool Want Arne Slot So Badly


Liverpool's search for Jurgen Klopp's replacement looks to have led them to Feyenoord's Arne Slot. The Dutchman has enjoyed two fantastic years in the Eredivisie, and looks like a natural fit for the club's style of play... but is he? FourFourTwo's Adam Clery takes an extensive look at his style of play and assesses why he's perfect and, also, why he isn't.

Key Players: Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Sol Campbell, Dennis Bergkamp, Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires. Honours: Premier League 03/04 (undefeated).





 








Trent Alexander-Arnold: Why I KNEW Moving Into Liverpool's Midfield Would Work


There’s been plenty of noise around Trent Alexander-Arnold’s performances for club and country over the past 12 months, but the man himself has maintained a cool head. Donning a retro shellsuit for FFT, the Merseyside maestro insists he still has lofty ambitions – none more so than becoming the best player in the world. We spent an hour with him at a secret location in his hometown of West Derby where we talked about his ambitions at Liverpool, his role for England, and whether or not he could see himself managing one day.

'I fell in love with football as I was later to fall in love with women: Suddenly. Inexplicably. Uncritically. Giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring with it': Nick Hornby, Fever Pitch

Thirty years later, FFT grabs lunch with the author himself to chew the pasta over Arsenal, Fever Pitch's legacy, the wider game - and just a touch more Arsenal...
