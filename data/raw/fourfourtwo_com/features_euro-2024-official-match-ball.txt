The Euro 2024 official match ball looks immaculate, with Adidas revealing what the players will be using this summer in Germany.Each nation heading to Euro 2024 now know what ball they'll be kicking around the Olympiastadion, Allianz Arena and Signal Iduna Park from June 14 to July 14, with fans getting a glimpse into how those iconic moments will look in years to come thanks to the orb leaving each players' boot. Named the Fussballliebe - meaning 'love of football' in German - it will be the first match ball in European Championships history to feature Connected Ball Technology, the same technology used in the World Cup 2022 Al Rihla ball.VIDEO: All You Need To Know About Euro 2024What does the Euro 2024 official match ball look like?The official match ball alongside the European trophy (Image credit: Reinaldo Coddou H. - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)Featuring a striking design, the Euro 2024 match ball is comprised of a range of colours, with blue, green, orange, red and yellow all incorporated in addition to the white base and larger black accents. Flowing throughout the ball, these black accents are what Adidas call "prominent black wing shapes accentuated with colourful edges, curves and dots".The aforementioned colours are supposed to "celebrate both the vibrance that the competing nations bring to the tournament and the pure simplicity of football that attracts so much love from fans around the world." Perhaps the coolest part of the design, though, is all eight host stadiums feature on the ball, with their individual outlines from a bird's eye view illustrated into the corners of the black elements. The names of each city is also included, in an attempt to bring everything together. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The sensor inside the Euro 2024 match ball (Image credit: Adidas)The design isn't the only cool part about the ball, either. A sensor is placed inside the Euro 2024 official match ball to help with semi-automated offside decisions, aiding VAR and referees come to the correct conclusion during games. Providing 500 pieces of data a second, the sensor helps detect when the ball is, or crucially isn't, touched. Covered entirely in polyurethane, the Fussballliebe also features a Butyl bladder - both of which are high-end materials to provide the best ball possible for the Euros. The cover is seamless, too, and is thermally bonded to ensure there aren't any bumps or ridges on the ball.Plus, it has got a debossed structure to, what Adidas claims, "improves precision and accuracy". Adidas Euro 2024 Fussballliebe Pro Ball price and where to buyThe Euro 2024 official match ball is available to buy for £130 from Adidas. It will feature in all 51 tournament matches this upcoming summer. Cheaper versions of the ball are also available, though they don't include the same high quality polyurethane material. Today's best Adidas Euro 2024 Fussballliebe Pro Ball deals £35View £105View £130ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesMore Euro 2024 storiesAll the Euro 2024 squads have been confirmed, with the favourites all hoping they'll be the ones lifting the trophy come the conclusion of the final.
