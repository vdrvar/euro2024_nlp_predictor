Where to buy








The Turkey Euro 2024 home kit might not be what many people were expecting, but the change is certainly welcome. With Turkey set to face Georgia, Portugal and Czech Republic at Euro 2024, how they play on the pitch will be more important than how they look - though looking good certainly won't be a hinderance. Fortunately for them, they've been issued one of the nicer Euro 2024 kits by Nike, even if it is slightly different to normal.The Turkey Euro 2024 home kit features the perfect blend of colourBUY THE SHIRTSHOP NIKE KITS Buy this shirt from Nike.comWhen Nike decided to flip Turkey's home and away colours in 2022, the choice seemed a little strange. Red now became the main colour featuring on the away shirt, while the home is predominantly white. Getting used to that might seem strange, but it's done no harm to how they actually look.Once again opting to centralise the Turkey crest, a consistent design choice from Nike, the Swoosh has also been placed in the centre of the chest to create better uniformity. Gone are the red accents placed on the sleeve cuffs and collar, too, bringing together something a little cleaner and more refined. Nike Turkey Euro 2024 home kit (Image credit: Getty Images)SEE THE AWAY(Image credit: Nike/Turkey)EURO 2024 KITS Turkey's Euro 2024 away kitWhat's great about the new home kit, though, is that it takes inspiration from what Turkey wore 100 years ago for their first-ever strip. While the laced collar no longer exists, white is now the main colour and the crest being centralised points back to those exact moments.Plus, the iconic red band across the front of the shirt has printed crease lines within it to emulate the early days when players wrapped the national flag around them with pride. It's a subtle choice by Nike, but it looks fantastic.Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nike Turkey Euro 2024 home kit (Image credit: Nike/Turkey)The polo collar is really a nice touch, too. Buy the shirtTurkey Euro 2024 home kit (Image credit: Nike/Turkey)Nike Turkey Euro 2024 home shirt    Simple yet effective, with some subtle design elements addedOur expert review:    SpecificationsColour: White/Sport RedSize: XS-XXXLToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonVisit SiteReasons to buy+Red chest band+Printed crease lines on red bandMore kit dropsNike have released all of their shirts, after Adidas dropped theirs.Belgium's home kit is a deeper red, with their away kit Tintin-inspired. Germany's home jersey and away jersey have gradient-style patterns, while Italy's home shirt and away shirt and Hungary's home kit and away kit are more subtle. The Spain home shirt and away shirt are both inspired by nature. France's home kit and away kit are brighter than recent moody efforts, as is the Netherlands home kit. The away kit, meanwhile, is more artistic: and Portugal have similar: their last Nike home jersey is a lighter red, with their away kit inspired by art.For Britain, England's home kit and away kit visit different ends of a spectrum. Scotland's home shirt is modern and brash while the away shirt is calmer in tone. Wales are yet to qualify – but their home shirt and away shirt are both safe options.
