England manager Gareth Southgate will have to contend with a disruption to his squad's preparations ahead of Euro 2024, with a key player guaranteed to miss their first warm up match.On June 3, England face Bosnia and Herzegovina at St. James' Park in their first of two warm-up games ahead of Euro 2024, before heading south to take on Iceland at Wembley four days later.With the Premier League concluding on May 19, the majority of the England squad will have four full weeks to prepare for their first Euro 2024 group match against Serbia on June 16, while players competing in the FA Cup final on May 25 will still have over three weeks.England will hope to go all the way in Germany (Image credit: Getty Images)One of Harry Kane or Jude Bellingham won't have that much time, however, with one of the duo guaranteed to reach the Champions League final on June 1, with Bayern Munich taking on Real Madrid in the semis. Arguably England's two most-important players, Southgate will be fretting over the fitness of whoever plays in Europe's showpiece game at Wembley, with one of the pair's involvement against Bosnia already ruled out. That factor could, naturally, have an adverse affect on England getting ready for the international tournament in Germany, with tactics and personnel having to accomodate the absence of either Kane or Bellingham.One of Bellingham and Kane are guaranteed to miss the start of England's Euro 2024 training camp (Image credit: Getty Images)Eric Dier and Jadon Sancho are also in with a chance of playing in the Champions League final, though it's unlikely Southgate will select either of them having left the pair out of his latest squad for March's friendlies against Belgium and Brazil. Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.In those games, England lost 1-0 to Brazil before clawing back a draw in the game against Belgium.
