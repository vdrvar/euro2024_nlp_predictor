With Arsenal signing young Brazilian stars such as Gabriel Martinelli and Marquinhos in recent years, another may be on the way as their first big coup of the transfer window. Arsenal opened their transfer window two years ago by signing a Brazilian prospect, in Marquinhos (Image credit: Getty Images)According to reports from the Evening Standard, Arsenal are amongst side's including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea who want to sign Estevao Willian.Aged just 17, the winger has already featured heavily for Brazilian side Palmeiras and started his footballing career with the academy of Cruzeiro in 2017.

(Image credit: Getty Images)Having already amassed over half a million followers on Instagram, Estevao is being dubbed the next big thing to come out of Brazil. Joao Paulo Sampaio, the head of Palmeiras' youth set-up, has already issued wholesale praise for the abilities shown by the 17-year-old star.He told FIFA: "One thing these kinds of players have is a strong personality, a big ego to say: "I am, I can and I will". And they do it. For these out-of-this-world talents, things come easy. It's difficult for your average player, who makes up the vast majority."Referring to his name, Sampaio said: "He prefers Estevao. The Messinho thing was put on hold, but his game is very similar to that of the Argentine."More Arsenal storiesArsenal could target an exciting Brazilian wonderkid as their first summer signing.The Gunners have also been linked with 'the next Messi' and could face complications in their efforts to sign Bologna's star striker.
