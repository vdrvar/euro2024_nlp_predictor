# Euro 2024 NLP Predictor

## Project Overview
The `euro2024_nlp_predictor` is an innovative project leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the world's leading football newspapers. Our goal is to predict the outcomes of Euro 2024 matches by extracting insights from vast amounts of football-related news, expert opinions, and match analyses.

## Features
- **News Aggregation**: Automated scraping of top football news sources for the latest insights, with adjustable depth and segment targeting.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauge the sentiment surrounding teams and players using NLP techniques.
- **Prediction Modeling**: Utilize historical data and current sentiment to predict match outcomes.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for visualizing predictions and underlying data.
- **Configurable Crawler**: Enhanced web crawler configurable for specific domains and path segments to focus on relevant content efficiently.

## Technology Stack
- Python for backend operations, including NLP and machine learning tasks.
- Beautiful Soup for web scraping.
- NLTK and spaCy for text processing and sentiment analysis.
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing predictive models.
- Streamlit or Dash for creating interactive web dashboards.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/euro2024_nlp_predictor.git
cd euro2024_nlp_predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
To start collecting data, use the configurable crawler which can be tailored to specific news sections or entire websites:

1. **Configure the crawler**: Adjust `configs` in `crawler.py` to target different news sections or set depth limits for scraping.
2. **Run the crawler**: Execute the script to begin scraping and collecting data.
3. **Process the data**: Use provided scripts to clean and analyze the collected data.
4. **Train the models**: Follow instructions in `model_training.py` to build and train your prediction models.
5. **Launch the dashboard**: Run `dashboard.py` to start the web interface.

Detailed instructions on using each component are available in the respective scripts within the project repository.
